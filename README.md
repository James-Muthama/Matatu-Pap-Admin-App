![Matatu Pap Admin App](https://via.placeholder.com/150) <!-- Replace with actual app logo or screenshot if available -->

**Matatu Pap Admin App** is a mobile application designed to streamline the management of *matatus* (public transport buses in Kenya). The app allows administrators to track matatus, add buses, define routes using Google Maps, and connect buses to specific routes. It simplifies route creation by enabling users to add stages (stops) along a route, leveraging Google Maps for ease of use.

## Features

- **Add a Matatu**: Register and manage details of matatus, including vehicle information.
- **Route Management**: Create and manage routes by adding stages (stops) using an intuitive Google Maps integration.
- **Connect Matatus to Routes**: Assign matatus to specific routes for efficient tracking and management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for administrators to easily manage matatu operations.

## Getting Started

- **Android Studio**: Required for building and running the app.
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed for cloning the repository.
- **Google Maps API Key**: Obtain a Google Maps API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform) to enable map functionality.
- **Firebase (Optional)**: If the app uses Firebase for backend services, set up a Firebase project.
